# AntiVac Tweets Analysis

This research project investigates how antivaxxers and antimaskers were discussed and attributed on X (formerly Twitter) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using computational analysis and framing theory, it explores the language used to describe these groups of entities.

## Methods
+ Data Collection: 9,904 original tweets collected from January 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, using Brandwatch with specific keywords.
+ Analysis: Natural Language Processing (NLP) with spaCy for dependency parsing to identify modifying words and grammatical relations.

## Key Findings
+ Diverse Attributions: Words like famous, rabid, selfish, crazy, and stupid were used to describe antivaxxers and antimaskers.
+ Negative Frame: Most discussions attributed negative characteristics to these groups, often employing sarcasm or harsh criticism.
